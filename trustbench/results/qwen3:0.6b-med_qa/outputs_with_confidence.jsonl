{"id": "truth-0142", "prompt": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nIn order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?\n<|assistant|>\n", "completion": "The journal editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a **case series** rather than a cohort study for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Retrospective vs. Prospective Design**: A cohort study is conducted prospectively, following a population over time, while a case series is retrospective, collecting data from individual patients. This difference in design makes the original study's findings less reliable or less generalizable.\n\n2. **Small Sample Size**: The study involved only 14 patients, which is relatively small. A case series typically uses a larger sample size, making it more suitable for analyzing specific patients rather than the entire population.\n\n3. **Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Outcomes**: The original study was a **prospective cohort**, meaning it followed patients over time, which is a controlled study. A case series, being retrospective, may lack the controlled environment to accurately assess outcomes.\n\n4. **Statistical Limitations**: The study already achieved a high union rate and reported no complications, suggesting the findings were statistically significant. However, a case series, being retrospective, may not capture such outcomes in the same manner.\n\nThe editor’s suggestion reflects a preference for studies with a **retrospective design** to focus on specific patients, avoiding the biases of a larger, ongoing study. Thus, the original study’s design was deemed less suitable for a case series.", "score": 1}
