{"prompt":"Does achieving mastery in a sport help make you smarter in school?","text":"Research suggests that there may be a positive correlation between athletic achievement and cognitive performance in certain domains, but this relationship is not universally established across all contexts. (Carson et al., 2017)\n\nAcademic studies have shown that athletes tend to perform better on spatial reasoning tasks compared to non-athletes, possibly due to the neural adaptations associated with physical exercise and sport participation. (Voss et al., 2002)\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that there is limited research specifically examining the relationship between athletic achievement and cognitive skills in school settings, and more studies are needed to fully understand this potential connection.\n\nSources:\n\n* Carson, R.
