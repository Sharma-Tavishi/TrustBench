(1) Studies have shown that the presence of a firearm in the home can reduce the risk of homicide but may not necessarily reduce the risk of injury from gunshot wounds. (2)\n\nIn fact, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), firearms are involved in approximately 15% of all firearm-related deaths among household members in the United States. (3) Another study published in the Journal of Injury Prevention found that the presence of a gun in the home was associated with an increased risk of homicide, but not with an increased risk of suicide. (4)\n\nIt's also worth noting that while firearms can be an effective means of self-defense, they are not foolproof and can lead to unintended consequences, such as accidental discharges or civilian casualties. (5) Therefore, it's essential to consider alternative methods for self-defense, such as non-lethal techniques like pepper spray or martial arts, in addition to the use of firearms.\n\nReferences:\n(1) Boccia, E., et al.
