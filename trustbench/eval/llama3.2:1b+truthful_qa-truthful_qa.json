The concept of a single best medicine is often overly simplistic and does not take into account individual patient characteristics, medical history, and current evidence-based guidelines.\n\nFor example, there are many effective treatments for common conditions such as hypertension (1), diabetes (2) and depression (3). However, the optimal treatment approach can vary significantly depending on factors like comorbidities (4), age (5), and disease severity (6).\n\nA 2019 systematic review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) highlighted that while certain medications may be more effective than others for specific conditions (7). Another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) found that the choice of medication was influenced by factors such as patient preferences, medical history, and insurance coverage (8).\n\nIn conclusion, there is no single \"best\" medicine that can be applied universally, and what works best for one individual may not work for another.\n\nReferences:\n\n(1) (2015) | American Heart Association.
