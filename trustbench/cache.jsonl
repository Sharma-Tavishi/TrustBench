{"text":"A question about some iconic hip-hop videos!\n\nSnoop Dogg's music videos \"Doggystyle\" (1993) and \"Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp\" (2002) are examples of gangsta rap films. Gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip-hop that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, characterized by its gritty realism, vivid storytelling, and often controversial lyrics.\n\nGangsta rap films, like these music videos, typically blend elements from various film genres, such as drama, action, and comedy. They often feature urban landscapes, crime, violence, and social commentary, which reflects the harsh realities of life in inner-city America (e.g., see \"Boyz N the Hood,\" 1991).\n\nIn terms of specific sources:\n\n* The music video for \"Doggystyle\" is a classic example of gangsta rap's early days. See: \"Snoop Dogg - Doggystyle (Official Music Video)\" on YouTube.\n* For \"Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp,\" see the official music video on MTV or Vevo.\n\nIn academic literature:\n\n* A comprehensive analysis of gangsta rap and its cultural significance can be found in:\n\t+ Rose, T. (1994). Black noise: Rap music and Black culture in contemporary America. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.\n* For a detailed examination of the social context that gave rise to gangsta rap, see:\n\t+ Kelley, R. D. G. (2002). Freedom dreams: The Black radical imagination.
